# Database Requirements

## Objective

Document the requirements of your database project. No formal template is required, but the following sections should be included in a requirement document (the italic parts are subsections).

## Introduction 

### Project Overview
Briefly describe the purpose of the database and its intended use. 

### Scope
Define the boundaries of the project, including what will and will not be covered (this could be a one paragraph shortened version from Project Part 1, repeated to maintain continuity). The previous two subsections establish continuity. 

### Glossary
Include a glossary of terms or acronyms (if any) used in the document.

## Stakeholders
Identify the database stakeholders, including end-users, administrators, and any other relevant parties. While some of these may need to be contrived, doing so demonstrates an understanding of the essential components of a requirements document.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
Specify the essential functions the database must perform. These functions can include user administration, data entry, retrieval, updates, deletions, and report generation. For report generation, refer to the sample queries/reports provided at the end of the project description for ideas. Additionally, as a team, brainstorm and propose other types of queries/reports that might be of interest to users. 

### Data Entities
List and describe the main data entities and their attributes and their data types or constraints. Note: these should represent major entities and their attributes (see the project description as the starting point); the list may be expanded upon when you develop the conceptual model.

### Non-Functional Requirements (_Optional_)
Include performance metrics, security requirements, and any other constraints like compliance with regulations. You will not be expected to show that the non-functional properties hold. 

## Hardware and Software Requirements
Specify the hardware and software requirements for the database system. Note: your database is likely to be standalone (running on MariaDB on EECS servers), on MySQL on one of your laptops, or on the cloud. Clearly define the expected hardware and software components. While this may seem trivial, including these details demonstrates an understanding of the essential parts of a requirements document.
